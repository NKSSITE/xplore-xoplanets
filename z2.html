    <h1>Diversity of Exoplanets</h1>

    <h2>1. Gas Giants</h2>
    <p>
        Gas giants are large planets mostly composed of gases such as hydrogen and helium. 
        They have very thick atmospheres and often lack a solid surface. Examples of gas giants among exoplanets include:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>HD 209458 b</strong>: This exoplanet is very similar to Jupiter but is located close to its star, resulting in extremely high temperatures. 
        Scientists call it a "hot Jupiter" because it differs from the gas giants in our Solar System.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Earth-like Planets</h2>
    <p>
        Earth-like planets are exoplanets that have solid surfaces and may have conditions suitable for life. 
        They are located in the "habitable zone" of their stars, where temperatures may be right for liquid water to exist. 
        An example of such an exoplanet is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Kepler-186f</strong>: It is Earth-sized and orbits its star within the habitable zone, making it one of the most exciting objects for searching for life beyond our Solar System.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Super-Earths</h2>
    <p>
        Super-Earths are exoplanets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. 
        They may have solid surfaces and possibly conditions suitable for life. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>GJ 1214 b</strong>: This super-Earth is located in the habitable zone of its star and has interesting atmospheric properties. 
        Scientists believe it may have oceans, making it a candidate for the search for life.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Hot Jupiters</h2>
    <p>
        Hot Jupiters are exoplanets that are similar to gas giants but are located very close to their stars. 
        This leads to high temperatures and unusual conditions. An example is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>WASP-12b</strong>: This exoplanet orbits its star in just 26 hours and has a temperature exceeding 2000 degrees Celsius.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Exotic Worlds</h2>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets have unique and unexpected characteristics. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>55 Cancri e</strong>: This exoplanet may have extreme temperatures and could experience diamond rains, 
        making it one of the most fascinating exoplanets known to scientists.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Water Worlds</h2>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets may contain large amounts of water on their surface. 
        This could be in the form of oceans. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>TRAPPIST-1 d</strong>: This exoplanet is located in the habitable zone of its star, and research suggests it may have oceans, 
        making it a candidate for the search for life.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Planets with Exotic Atmospheric Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets have unique atmospheres that differ significantly from Earth's atmosphere. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>K2-18 b</strong>: Scientists have discovered that this exoplanet may have clouds and water vapor in its atmosphere, 
        opening up the possibility of supporting life.
