        <h2>What are Exoplanets?</h2>
        <p>
            Everything we know about planets usually relates to our Solar System: Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and other familiar planets.
            But in fact, there are many more planets in the universe. These planets are called exoplanets — they orbit stars outside our Solar System.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Simple Explanation:</strong>
            Exoplanets are like Earth but are located far beyond our Solar System and orbit other stars.
            Our telescopes can observe these stars and discover exoplanets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How are Exoplanets Discovered?</strong>
            Scientists use special telescopes to detect exoplanets. One of the most famous telescopes is Kepler,
            which has discovered thousands of exoplanets. Thanks to it, scientists have found worlds that may have conditions suitable for life.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The first exoplanets were only discovered in 1992! Now we know of more than 5,000 exoplanets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Some exoplanets are much larger than Jupiter — the largest planet in our Solar System, while others can be
            about the same size as Earth.

        <h2>How Do Scientists Search for Exoplanets?</h2>
        <p>
            There are several ways scientists find exoplanets. Let's explore two of the most popular methods:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Transit Method:</strong>
            This method is used to find exoplanets that pass in front of their star. When a planet passes in front of its star,
            the star’s light becomes slightly dimmer because the planet blocks some of the light. This helps scientists determine
            the size of the planet and its distance from the star.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> If you stand in front of a flashlight, the light dims. Similarly, stars lose some light when an exoplanet
            passes in front of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Radial Velocity Method:</strong>
            Planets not only orbit their star — they also pull on it slightly. This causes the star to "wobble."
            Scientists can measure this movement of the star to determine that a planet is nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Most exoplanets have been found using the transit method!

        <h2>The First Exoplanets</h2>
        <p>
            The first exoplanets were discovered in 1992 around a star called PSR B1257+12. It was a special case because the star
            turned out to be a pulsar — a dying star emitting radio waves, and the planets around it were in very extreme conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Kepler and New Discoveries:</strong>
            When the Kepler space telescope was launched in 2009, scientists gained the ability to study a huge number of stars.
            Kepler observed how planets passed in front of their stars, and with its help, thousands of exoplanets were discovered.
            Many of these worlds are at enormous distances, but thanks to them, scientists now better understand how other planetary systems might look.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Some exoplanets orbit two stars, just like in the movie "Star Wars"! These systems are called binary systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Modern Telescopes:</strong>
            Now scientists are using a new telescope — the James Webb Space Telescope — to learn even more about exoplanets.
            This telescope can "see" the atmospheres of exoplanets and help understand whether they may have conditions for life.
