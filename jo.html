            <p>
                Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. The first confirmed discovery of an exoplanet was in 1992, and since then, scientists have identified more than 5,000 exoplanets across the galaxy. These planets can vary widely in size, composition, and conditions. Some are rocky, much like Earth, while others are gas giants or icy bodies similar to Jupiter and Neptune. Some exoplanets are located in the "habitable zone" of their star—the region where conditions may be suitable for liquid water, a key ingredient for life as we know it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The discovery of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. It has shown us that planetary systems are common and can be found around many different types of stars, including stars that are smaller, larger, or very different from our own Sun. The diversity of these planetary systems has challenged long-held ideas about how planets form and evolve.

                    <h3>Rocky Exoplanets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rocky exoplanets, also known as terrestrial planets, are composed mostly of rock and metal, similar to Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. These planets have solid surfaces and can vary in size from smaller than Earth to slightly larger. Rocky exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star—where conditions might allow for the presence of liquid water—are of particular interest to scientists searching for life beyond Earth. These planets could potentially have atmospheres and support biological processes, making them prime targets for future exploration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One famous example of a rocky exoplanet is **Kepler-452b**, which orbits a star similar to the Sun and is located in the habitable zone. It is often called "Earth's cousin" due to its size and potential for Earth-like conditions, though it is much older than Earth.

                    <h3>Gas Giants</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gas giants are massive planets composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, much like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. These planets do not have a solid surface, and their atmospheres can be hundreds of kilometers thick. Some gas giants, known as **"hot Jupiters,"** orbit extremely close to their parent stars and have very high surface temperatures. Others, like **"cold Jupiters,"** orbit farther from their stars and have much cooler atmospheres.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gas giants are often much easier to detect than smaller, rocky planets due to their size. Their large gravitational influence on their parent stars makes them easier to spot using indirect detection methods like the radial velocity technique. One well-known gas giant is **HD 209458b**, also known as Osiris. It was the first exoplanet observed to transit its star, providing valuable information about its atmosphere and composition.

                    <h3>Ice Giants</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ice giants, like Neptune and Uranus in our solar system, are planets that are composed mostly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane. Despite their name, ice giants are not entirely made of ice but contain large amounts of volatile substances that are usually frozen in the outer solar system. These planets have thick atmospheres and are often found in the outer regions of their planetary systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ice giants are less common than gas giants in exoplanet surveys, but they provide important clues about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Their composition and distance from their parent stars make them interesting objects of study, particularly for understanding how different planetary systems develop over time.

        <!-- Section 3: How Are Exoplanets Detected? -->
        <section class="section detection">
            <h2>How Are Exoplanets Detected?</h2>
            <p>
                Detecting exoplanets is a major challenge for astronomers because they are located far from Earth and are much dimmer than the stars they orbit. Most exoplanets cannot be seen directly, so scientists use several indirect methods to detect them. The most common detection methods include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transit Method:</strong> This method involves observing a star and watching for small dips in brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it. These "transits" provide information about the planet's size, orbit, and sometimes its atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Radial Velocity:</strong> By measuring the slight wobble in a star's motion caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet, scientists can estimate the planet's mass and orbit. This method is particularly useful for finding large planets, like gas giants.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Imaging:</strong> In rare cases, astronomers can directly observe exoplanets by capturing images of them using powerful telescopes. This method is challenging because the star's light is much brighter than the planet's, but it provides valuable information about the planet's atmosphere and surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Gravitational Microlensing:</strong> When a star passes in front of a more distant star, the gravitational field of the nearer star can act like a lens, magnifying the light from the more distant star. If the nearer star has a planet, its gravitational field can cause additional changes in the light, revealing the presence of the planet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these methods provides different types of information about exoplanets, and combining these techniques allows scientists to create a more complete picture of the distant worlds they study.

        <!-- Section 4: Why Are Exoplanets Important? -->
        <section class="section importance">
            <h2>Why Are Exoplanets Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Exoplanets are important for several reasons. First, they help us understand how planets form and evolve. By studying a wide range of planetary systems, scientists can learn more about the processes that shaped our own solar system and why planets like Earth are rare. Exoplanets also provide valuable insights into the potential for life elsewhere in the universe. Finding planets in the habitable zone of their stars raises the exciting possibility that these worlds could host life, or at least have the right conditions for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The study of exoplanets also helps scientists understand the diversity of planetary systems. Before exoplanets were discovered, astronomers believed that most planetary systems would look similar to our own. However, the discovery of "hot Jupiters," planets with highly elliptical orbits, and even planets orbiting binary star systems has shown that planetary systems are far more diverse than anyone expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, exoplanet research has practical implications for the future of space exploration. As technology improves, future space missions may focus on sending probes or even crewed missions to nearby exoplanets, especially those in the habitable zone. This makes the study of exoplanets not just a scientific endeavor but also a crucial step toward humanity's long-term exploration of the cosmos.

                    <p>
                        TRAPPIST-1e is one of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a small star 40 light-years away. This system has become one of the most exciting discoveries in recent years because three of the planets, including TRAPPIST-1e, are located in the star's habitable zone. This makes TRAPPIST-1e a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.

                    <h3>Proxima Centauri b</h3>
                    <p>
                        Proxima Centauri b is the closest known exoplanet to Earth, located just 4.2 light-years away. It orbits its parent star in the habitable zone, making it a key target for future space missions. Although Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star, which means its planet may experience extreme stellar activity, Proxima Centauri b remains one of the most studied exoplanets due to its proximity to Earth.
