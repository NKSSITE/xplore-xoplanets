        <h2>Paragraph 4: The Meaning of Exoplanet Names</h2>
        <p>
            The names of exoplanets often reflect cultural, historical, or scientific aspects, making them more memorable and interesting to study. Exoplanets are usually named after their parent stars, but their full names can vary.
        </p>
        <h3>Names of Parent Stars</h3>
        <p>
            Exoplanets are typically named in relation to their parent stars. For example, the planet <em>Kepler-22b</em> is named after the star <em>Kepler-22</em>, around which it orbits.
        </p>
        <h3>Mythology and History</h3>
        <p>
            Many exoplanets are named after mythological or historical figures. For instance, the exoplanet <em>HAT-P-7b</em> is named after a mythical character, and the exoplanet <em>K2-18b</em> is named after the poet and writer <em>C.S. Lewis</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Scientific Concepts</h3>
        <p>
            Some exoplanets are named after well-known scientific concepts or discoveries. For example, the exoplanet <em>HD 209458b</em> is known as <em>Osiris</em>, linked to the myth of the ancient Egyptian god of fertility.
        </p>
        <h3>Cultural Aspects</h3>
        <p>
            In some cases, exoplanet names are associated with cultural aspects, such as geography or literature. This adds more meaning and context to the study of exoplanets.
        </p>
        <h3>Naming Procedure</h3>
        <p>
            The naming of exoplanets is regulated by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which periodically holds contests to select names for newly discovered exoplanets. This helps engage the public in astronomy and make it more accessible.
        </p>
        <h2>The Meaning of Numbers in Exoplanet Names</h2>
        <p>
            The numbers in exoplanet names are significant because they help astronomers identify planets and their parent stars:
        </p>
        <h3>Star Identification</h3>
        <p>
            The first letters in an exoplanet’s name, such as "HD," "BD," "Kepler," or "K2," indicate the catalog from which the star was taken. For example, "HD" refers to the Henry Draper catalog, while "Kepler" indicates stars discovered through the <em>Kepler</em> space telescope mission.
        </p>
        <h3>Star Number</h3>
        <p>
            The next part, consisting of numbers, refers to the unique number of the star in the respective catalog. For example, in the name <em>HD 209458</em>, "209458" is the unique number of the star in the Henry Draper catalog.
        </p>
        <h3>Letters Indicating the Planet</h3>
        <p>
            After the star’s name, a letter may follow, indicating a specific exoplanet orbiting the star. Typically, "b" is used for the first discovered exoplanet, with "c," "d," etc., for subsequent planets. For example, <em>HD 209458 b</em> refers to the first exoplanet found orbiting the star <em>HD 209458</em>.
        </p>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Kepler-22b</em>: "Kepler" refers to a star discovered via the <em>Kepler</em> mission, "22" is its number in the catalog, and "b" indicates that it is the first exoplanet discovered around that star.</li>
            <li><em>HD 189733 b</em>: "HD" stands for the Henry Draper catalog, "189733" is the unique number of the star in this catalog, and "b" indicates the first exoplanet found around this star.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus, the numbers and letters in exoplanet names help astronomers quickly identify stars and planets, providing a clear and unified naming system.
