    <h1>Exoplanet Detection Methods and Their Characteristics</h1>

    <h2>Exoplanet Detection Methods</h2>

    <h3>1. Transit Method</h3>
    <p>
        The transit method is based on observing the light from a star. When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, 
        it blocks part of the light reaching Earth. Scientists can detect a small dip in the star's brightness during the transit. 
        For example, <strong>Kepler-186f</strong> was discovered using this method.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Radial Velocity Method</h3>
    <p>
        This method uses the Doppler effect. As an exoplanet orbits its star, it causes small wobbles in the star, 
        which shifts the light's color. An example of this method is the discovery of the exoplanet <strong>51 Pegasi b</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Direct Observation</h3>
    <p>
        This method involves using telescopes to directly observe exoplanets. An example is 
        <strong>Fomalhaut b</strong>, which was photographed in 2008.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Microlensing</h3>
    <p>
        The microlensing method is based on a gravitational effect. If an exoplanet passes in front of a more distant star, 
        its gravitational field can bend the star's light. This method led to the discovery of the exoplanet <strong>MOA-2007-BLG-192-L b</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Using Space Telescopes</h3>
    <p>
        Space telescopes such as <strong>Kepler</strong> and <strong>TESS</strong> were specifically designed to search for exoplanets 
        and provide more accurate observations.
    </p>

    <h2>Exoplanet Characteristics</h2>

    <h3>1. Size and Mass</h3>
    <p>
        These parameters determine the planet's gravity and atmospheric conditions. For example, low-mass exoplanets are likely to be rocky, 
        while massive planets are gas giants.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Orbital Period</h3>
    <p>
        The time it takes for an exoplanet to complete one full orbit around its star. Planets with short orbits, 
        such as hot Jupiters, have high temperatures.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Temperature</h3>
    <p>
        Depends on the planet's distance from its star and its atmosphere. Exoplanets in the habitable zone may have conditions 
        suitable for liquid water to exist.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Composition</h3>
    <p>
        Exoplanets can be rocky, gaseous, or icy. For example, rocky planets like Earth consist mainly of solid materials.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Atmosphere</h3>
    <p>
        The composition and density of an atmosphere are critical for understanding the conditions on the planet. The presence of water in the atmosphere 
        could indicate the potential for life.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Axial Tilt and Orbital Eccentricity</h3>
    <p>
        Axial tilt affects seasonal changes, and the eccentricity of the orbit determines how much the orbit deviates from being circular.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Presence of Moons</h3>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets may have their own moons, which can provide additional information about the planet.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Presence of Rings</h3>
    <p>
        Some exoplanets may have ring systems, offering new insights into their structure.
